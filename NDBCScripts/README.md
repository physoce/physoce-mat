These are a series of functions all designed around gathering and organizing data
from NDBC Data buoys.  The main function is NDBCReader.m and it calls other 
functions as necessary.  It is currently only set up to gather the standard
meteorological data but I hope I have commented my code enough that it should
be relatively easy to modify.
